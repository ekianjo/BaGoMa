- Add a lock file (per backup dir) to prevent the user from doing something dumb
  like run two backups for the same account in parallel, or a "compact" in
  parallel with a "backup", etc...

- Save the e-mail info in the backupDir in case the user decides to do a backup
  of account A in the backupDir of account B.

- Optionally compress local email message files.

- When printing folder names, first decode the name, in case it's in the
  "modified" UTF-7 encoding.
