- Add a lock file (per cacheDir) to prevent the user from doing something dumb
  like run two backups for the same account in parallel, or a "compact" in
  parallel with a "backup", etc...

- Save the e-mail info in the cacheDir in case the user decides to do a backup
  of account A in the cacheDir of account B.

- Allow BaGoMa to be used for account migrations (backup from account A,
  restore to account B).

- Optionally compress local email message files.

- When printing folder names, first decode the name, in case it's in the
  "modified" UTF-7 encoding.
