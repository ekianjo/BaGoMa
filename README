NAME
====

BaGoMa - A script to *Ba*ckup *Go*ogle *Ma*il.

bAgOmA - A script to backup a *bag* *o*' *ma*il.

SYNOPSIS
========

`bagoma.py` [*options*] `-e` <*Email*>

DESCRIPTION
===========

BaGoMa backs-up and restores the contents of a GMail account. It can
restore all the labels (folder structure), as well as the flags (seen/read,
flagged) of a message. It differs from other similar solutions in a few
important ways:

* It is Open Source Software. You can read the code to make sure your password
and email contents remain private.

* Some backup solutions force you to use only ASCII characters in your labels.
BaGoMa has no such restrictions on label names. Specifically, foreign
characters and '/' (the label hierarchy delimiter) are allowed.

* BaGoMa is tuned to work specifically with GMail. Each message is only
downloaded and saved once. Backup solutions that are designed to work with
regular IMAP accounts will donwload each message multiple times (once per
label) when used to back up a GMail account. That can significantly increase
the bandwidth requirements and the amount of storage required for backup.
Additionally, a faithful restoration of your GMail account might not be
possible from such a backup.


BaGoMa requires your GMail account to be IMAP accessible. Check the Mail
Settings and make sure "Enable IMAP" is selected under the "Forwarding and
POP/IMAP" tab. In the "Folder Size Limits" section on the same tab, make sure
the following option is selected: "Do not limit the number of messages in an
IMAP folder".

BaGoMa never deletes any email from your account. A *restore* simply
compares the contents of your local backup with the contents of your GMail
account, and uploads any messages missing from your GMail account. It never
deletes messages from GMail to make it match the local backup.

Google sometimes imposes limits on how much data can be transfered from your
account. If you run into such a limitation, just wait a few days and try the
backup again. BaGoMa will pick up from where it left off. If the temporary
loss of IMAP access is critical to you, think twice before using this script.
As far as I'm aware, web access to your email should continue unimpeded even
if IMAP access is blocked.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, \--help
:	show a help message and exit

-e *EMAIL*, \--email=*EMAIL*
:	the email address to log in with (MANDATORY)

-p *PWD*, \--pwd=*PWD*
:	the password to log in with (will prompt if missing)

-d *CACHEDIR*, \--dir=*CACHEDIR*
:	the backup/restore directory [default: GMailBackup]

-a *ACTION*, \--action=*ACTION*
:	the action to perform: backup, restore, purge or printIndex [default:
	backup]

-s *SERVER*, \--server=*SERVER*
:	the GMail server to use [default: imap.gmail.com]

\--port=*PORT*
:	the IMAP port to use for GMail [default: 993]

-l *LOGLEVEL*, \--log=*LOGLEVEL*
:	the console log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) [default:
	WARNING]

-f *LOGFILE*, \--file=*LOGFILE*
:	the log file (set it to 'off' to disable logging) [default: log.txt]


INSTALL
=======
On Linux you can either execute the `bagoma.py` script directly, or install using:

	python setup.py install

LIMITATIONS
===========
BaGoMa will NOT backup any of the following:

* Account settings (filter, etc...)
* Contacts
* Chat history
* Labels you've chosen to hide in IMAP
* Superstars (the additional star icons that can be enabled in Labs)
* Contents of Trash and Spam

The IMAP protocol does not provide a trully unique ID for an email message
(UIDVALIDITY + UID doesn't count). In order to determine that message _A_ in
folder _P_ is the same as message _B_ in folder _Q_ (and only needs to be
downloaded once), the script computes its own unique ID using the following
header fields:

* From:
* To:
* Cc:
* Date:
* Subject:
* X-GMail-Received:
* Message-Id:
* The server assigned timestamp of when the message was received

Two messages that have identical values (ignoring whitespace) for _all_ of the
fields enumerated above are considered to be identical and will only be
downloaded and saved once. The chance of two messages having the same
Message-Id header field is pretty slim. The chance of all the header fields
mentioned above being identical is _almost_ 0.


DEVELOPERS
==========
Latest version available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagoma

The `imaplib` library is used to do the heavy lifting. In addition to the
official documentation, some useful information on imaplib can be found at:

	http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/imaplib/

The README file uses [Markdown] formatting with [pandoc] extensions so that it
can be converted to a man page. To create a groff man page out of the README,
use the following command:

	pandoc -s -w man README -o bagoma.1
	man -l bagoma.1

See the _TODO_ file.

REPORTING BUGS
==============
Report bugs to gburca dash imap at ebixio dot com. Better yet, provide patches to fix the bugs.

Bug reports should include relevant portions of the log file.
