v01.40 2012-07-17
=================
	* Allow email clients to read/verify the local backup by exposing the
	messages through a Maildir formatted directory.
	* Added new 'stats' action. BaGoMa needs to detect which folder is used
	for "Sent Mail" before stats can be generated, so it won't work on an
	old backup until you update it by using the 'backup' action first.

=================
	* Added config file for storing passwords
	* Added simple GUI


v01.20 2011-06-24

	* Decode UTF-7 folder names using imap_utf7.py from IMAPClient
